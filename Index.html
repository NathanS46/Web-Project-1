    <h2>Why Computers are important</h2>
    <p><em><u>Here in Canada and most parts of the world we all use some form of a computer everyday from our phones to a nice desktop 
      Computers are in some way involved in our every day lives.</u></em> Computers were built in 1991 by Alan Turing in the Country of Germany</p>


<h2>My Computer Specs</h2>

<h2> Types of high preformance computers for gaming</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of gaming computers, Gaming laptops and desktops.<br/>
Gaming laptops are portable but normally have less preformance due to the limited amount of battery they can hold.<br>
Desktop gaming is normally more powerful due to the unlimited power supply but they are not portable and generally really big for maximum preformance<br/>
